# Welcome to my portfolio!

1) To run the portfolio code locally, clone the repo and checkout `main`.

2) After, run `npm start` to run the local development server and see changes to the website update in real-time.

3) When changes are finalized: commit changes, push, and run `npm run deploy` to update the deployed website. An automatic GitHub Actions should then split the deploy artifacts onto the `gh-pages` branch, and then update the live website.
